## Some notes on my faith

“A time is coming when men will go mad, and when they see someone who is not mad, they will attack him, saying, 'You are mad; you are not like us.” - St. Antony the Great

### A respectful segway for the world as it stands today

The world has a growing hostility towards the Christian worldview, a manifestation of a man's faulted spirit in the way of God's divine revelation. I am not a supporter of modern-day evangelist movements that seek to raise themselves up by the judgement of others. As an Orthodox Christian, I am called to be a living witness to **The Way**, **The Truth**, and **The Life**.

As Paul says, "If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me" - Philemon 1:18

I apologize for the actions and beliefs held due to wrongful and neglectful orators of the faith.

Discovering the Greek Orthodox Church in the heart of the Western world, in America, has been a transformative journey of profound spiritual depth and cultural richness. Embracing Orthodoxy has connected me to a tradition steeped in ancient wisdom, where the mystical chants of Byzantine hymns resonate alongside the timeless icons that adorn sacred spaces.

In this journey, I have found a spiritual home where reverence for tradition meets a profound exploration of faith, inviting me into a communion of believers whose devotion spans centuries. Through the teachings of the Church Fathers and the sacramental life, I have encountered a vibrant tapestry of theology and spirituality that continues to illuminate my path and nourish my soul.

Embracing Christian Orthodoxy in the West has not only deepened my understanding of God but has also enriched my connection to a global community of believers, bound by the timeless beauty of Orthodoxy's faith and practice.
